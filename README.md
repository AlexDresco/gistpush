> Add your files/content to gist easily with a single command.

Now there is no need for you to open up your gist/github account to upload a gist. Just write your code/content in a file and name the file as you would in the gist. Then upload it to your account as publicly or privately accessible using the command line.

## Installation

`npm i --global gistpush`

## Usage

Run `gistpush <file_name>`

> Supports multiple file uploads: `gistpush <file_name1> <file_name2> ...`
